# Description: Implement the board game Janggi, with a class (JanggiGame) for
# playing the game.

class JanggiGame:
    """
    An implementation of the board game Janggi. Has two Player objects and
    a Board object that it initializes to start the game. The game is played
    by using this class's make_move method. This class keeps track of the turn,
    whether the generals are in check, and determines if the game is over. It
    must interact with the Board and the Player to determine where the pieces
    are and what their allowed moves are. It also communicates with the Player's
    General objects because it needs to pass information from the opposing
    Player to the General, which would not be available to the General.
